 #### Developed a modern e-commerce application with both customer-facing and admin functionality:
<sub>   Frontend: Vue 3 (Composition API, <​script setup>), TypeScript, Pinia, Sass;.</sub>

 <sub>  Core features: product catalog with filtering and search, product detail page with color selection, shopping cart with quantity & total price calculation, favorites list;.</sub>
 
 <sub> Admin panel: product creation/editing with tab-based forms, category and color management;.</sub>
 
<sub> UX: implemented dynamic colorKey generation to handle product variants (different colors of the same product) correctly in the cart;.</sub>

 <sub> State management: clean Pinia store architecture (state, getters, actions), localStorage persistence;.</sub>
 
<sub>  Design system: Sass variables for typography, colors, and responsive layout.</sub>
